# MANFE
This is the repo for MANFE (stands for Maximum a Normalizing Flow Estimate), a MIMO signal detection framework which does not require any statistical knowledge on the noise. The associated paper is now published by IEEE Transactions on Communications and you can check the [Preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.08435) online for free if you are interested.
