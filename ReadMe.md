# MANFE
This is the repo for manfe, a MIMO signal detection framework, which does not require any statistical knowledge on the noise. The associated paper is now accepted by IEEE Transactions on Communications and you can check the [Preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.08435) online if you are interested.

## Under construction

Please be patient and wait. We are now working on cleaning the code for publication.
